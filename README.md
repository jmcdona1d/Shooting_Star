# Shooting Star Game

*The contents of this repository were copied from another git repository (previously hosted on a private server) used for the development of this game for an academic project.*

This is a desktop arcade-style game created with C++ and SDL with a team of 6 members. Players control a ball and navigate eit through an endlessly scrolling field of obstacles. Along the way, collecting dots grant score points. The game ends after hitting 3 obstacles.
